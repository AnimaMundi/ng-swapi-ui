# Task

Based on the included mockup, create a single page application 
which will display a list of au pairs and their personal details.
The user will be able to filter the list of au pairs based on 
criteria (left sidebar) as well as search.


### Notes:

* It should be created using Angular 2
* The filters are only accepting single values - 
they are not multiselect *(extra points if you make them multiselect)*
* The search functionality searches in the name and "about" text (the *lorem ipsum* one)
* Search input and filters are working together in an **AND** relationship, meaning that 
if a filter is selected, the search will take that into account, and vice-versa
* Extra points if it is responsive
* No need to worry about cross-browser issues


### Included files:

* The mockup in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) (for MacOS users) or PDF format
* A data.json file with mock data of users and their personal details
* In the `/src/assets` directory are included:
	* An `/icons` directory with SVG symbols definition and a 
	folder with all individual SVGs, so that you can choose which one you prefer to use
	* A `/css` directory with an .scss file with some basic variables to help you get started
* In the `/src/assets` directory are included a basic Angular 2 (rc.5) bootstrap file, 
a module and the base component


### Expected deliverable:

* A complete and fully functioning application, as a zip file, 
that I can install and run on any computer
