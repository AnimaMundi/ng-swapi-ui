## Task

Based on the included mockup, create a single page application which will display a list of au pairs and their personal details.
The user will be able to filter the list of au pairs based on criteria (left sidebar) as well as search.


#### Notes:

* It should be created using any front end technologies you prefer *(extra points for using Angular 2)*.
* The filters are only accepting single values - they are not multiselect *(extra points if you make them multiselect)*.
* The search functionality searches in the name and "about" text (the *lorem ipsum* one).
* Extra points if it is responsive
* No need to worry about cross-browser issues


#### Included files:

* An .scss file with some basic variables to help you get started
* The mockup in Sketch or PDF format
* A data.json file with a list of users and their personal details, to be used by the application as a mock service
* An SVG symbols definition and a folder with all SVGs, so that you can choose which one you prefer to use


#### Expected deliverable:

* A complete and fully functioning application, as a zip file, that I can install and run on any computer
